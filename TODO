- spec advanced and simple carts (other stuff should work)
- simple and advanced carts should have same interface
- it should works without logger
- move all the stuff into model (Cart::Simple.new etc)
- config should take strings as well (Cart.product_model = "Product")
- config should have default values (Product, OrderItem)
- standalone configuration class (maybe something like configatron?) => easier testing
